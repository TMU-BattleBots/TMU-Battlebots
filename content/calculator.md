# Combat Robot Calculator

Our team has developed several calculators and tools to help design and optimize combat robots. These tools can help you calculate motor power, weapon energy, and other important specifications for your robot.

## Basic Calculator

The basic calculator helps with quick calculations for motor power, weapon energy, and basic specifications.

### Features:
- Motor KV to RPM conversion
- Battery configuration calculations
- Weight class optimization

### Calculator Tool

{% include calculator-form.html %}

### How to Use:

1. Enter your robot's weight in pounds
2. Select the weapon type (spinner, hammer, flipper, crusher)
3. Enter the motor KV rating
4. Select the battery cell count (S rating)
5. Click "Calculate" to see the results

### Results Include:
- Maximum RPM
- Stored energy (in Joules)
- Tip speed
- Spinup time
- Recommended motor type
- Recommended battery specifications

## Interactive Simulator

For more advanced calculations and simulations, we've developed a full interactive simulator with weapon system, drivetrain, and armor calculations.

### Features:
- Interactive visual design
- Armor impact resistance calculations
- Drive system simulations
