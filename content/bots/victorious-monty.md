## Victorious Monty: The Horizontal Threat

Victorious Monty represents our exploration into horizontal spinner weapons in the 1lb class. Named after a team member's pet python, this bot brings a unique combination of reach and power to the arena.

The horizontal spinner extends beyond the frame, allowing Monty to strike opponents while maintaining a safe distance. This design philosophy prioritizes offensive capability while minimizing vulnerability.

### Engineering Innovations

We implemented several innovative features in Victorious Monty, including a custom-designed weapon motor mount that allows for quick replacement between matches. The frame utilizes a monocoque design for maximum structural integrity while minimizing weight.

The weapon bar is made from hardened S7 tool steel, providing excellent durability and impact resistance. We've carefully balanced the bar to minimize vibrations during high-speed operation.

### Tournament History

Victorious Monty has participated in five tournaments to date, with three podium finishes. Its most memorable match was against a vertical spinner where Monty's extended reach proved decisive in keeping the opponent at bay while inflicting damage.
