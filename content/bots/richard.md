## Richard: The Heavyweight Champion

Richard represents the pinnacle of our combat robotics engineering. Named after our founding team captain, this 30lb bot combines raw power with sophisticated control systems to dominate the heavyweight division.

The development of Richard took over six months, with countless hours spent on design, simulation, testing, and refinement. The result is a bot that has won three consecutive regional championships.

### Weapon System

Richard's primary weapon is a massive horizontal spinner that spans nearly the entire width of the bot. The bar is machined from a single piece of S7 tool steel and weighs approximately 8 pounds - over 25% of the bot's total weight allowance.

The weapon is powered by a custom-wound brushless motor that delivers over 2 horsepower at maximum speed. The spinner can reach 9,000 RPM, storing an incredible amount of kinetic energy that can tear through opponent armor with ease.

### Advanced Electronics

What truly sets Richard apart is its advanced control system. The bot features a custom-designed control board with gyroscopic stabilization that helps maintain control during intense weapon impacts. The system can detect when the bot is unstable and automatically adjust the drive power to compensate.

Richard also includes telemetry systems that provide real-time data to the operator, including weapon speed, motor temperatures, battery voltage, and impact detection. This information allows for strategic adjustments during matches.

### Tournament Success

Richard's competition record speaks for itself: 15 wins, 2 losses over three major tournaments. The bot has become something of a legend in the regional circuit, with opponents often modifying their designs specifically to counter Richard's powerful weapon system.

We continue to refine and improve Richard with each competition, implementing lessons learned and exploring new technologies. The current iteration (Mark IV) features improved armor mounting, better heat management, and an upgraded weapon controller.
