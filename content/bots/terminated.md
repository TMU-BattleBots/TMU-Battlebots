## Terminated: The Unstoppable Crusher

Terminated draws inspiration from sci-fi movies, with a menacing appearance and relentless fighting style. This 3lb bot features a powerful crushing weapon designed to pierce armor and immobilize opponents.

The red LED "eyes" and metallic skull-like appearance make Terminated instantly recognizable in the arena. The psychological impact on opponents shouldn't be underestimated - several competitors have made driving errors when faced with Terminated's intimidating approach.

### Crushing Mechanism

The heart of Terminated is its hydraulic crushing arm. Using a custom-designed miniature hydraulic system, the crusher can exert over 500 pounds of pressure at the tip - more than enough to penetrate most armor used in the 3lb class.

The crusher arm is shaped to trap opponents once grabbed, making escape difficult. This allows Terminated to control the match by grabbing an opponent and dragging them around the arena or into hazards.

### Control System

Terminated features one of our most advanced control systems, with pressure sensors in the crusher arm that provide feedback to the operator. This allows for precise control of crushing force - enough to damage components without wasting energy.

The drive system uses four independently controlled wheels with high-traction rubber tires, giving Terminated excellent pushing power once it has an opponent in its grasp.
