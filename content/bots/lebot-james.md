## Lebot James: Bringing Basketball to the Arena

Lebot James is our tribute to basketball excellence in robot form. This 1lb bot features a unique overhead hammer weapon designed to "slam dunk" opponents into submission.

The basketball theme extends beyond just the name - the bot features orange and black color schemes, and the hammer head is designed to resemble a basketball. Even the driving style mimics basketball movements, with quick direction changes and "jukes" to outmaneuver opponents.

### Technical Specifications

The overhead hammer is powered by a high-torque servo motor that allows for precise control and rapid strikes. We've implemented a custom gear reduction system to maximize impact force while maintaining speed.

The drive system uses four independently controlled wheels for maximum maneuverability, allowing Lebot to perform "crossover" moves to dodge incoming attacks.

### Fan Favorite

While not always the tournament winner, Lebot James has consistently been voted "Fan Favorite" at competitions due to its unique theme and entertaining driving style. The crowd goes wild whenever Lebot lands a successful "slam dunk" on an opponent!

Future iterations may include a pneumatic system to increase hammer power, though maintaining weight restrictions remains a challenge.
