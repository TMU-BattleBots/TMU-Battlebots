## Chop Chop: Precision Strikes

Chop Chop brings the ancient art of axe combat to the modern robot arena. This 3lb bot features a powerful overhead axe designed to penetrate opponent armor and damage internal components.

The name "Chop Chop" reflects both the weapon style and our design philosophy of quick, repeated strikes. Unlike some axe bots that rely on single, powerful hits, Chop Chop can deliver multiple rapid strikes in succession.

### Weapon Design

The axe head is made from hardened tool steel with a sharpened edge for maximum penetration. We've carefully balanced the weapon to allow for quick retractions after strikes, minimizing the vulnerability window.

The axe is powered by a combination of a high-torque servo and a spring-loaded mechanism that stores energy for powerful strikes. This hybrid approach allows for both power and control.

### Defensive Capabilities

Chop Chop isn't just about offense. The bot features a heavily armored front section that doubles as a wedge, allowing it to deflect horizontal spinners and get underneath opponents. The sides are protected by hardened polycarbonate panels that can withstand significant impacts.

The axe itself serves as a self-righting mechanism. If Chop Chop is flipped over, the axe can be used to push against the arena floor and right the bot - a feature that has saved us in several close matches.
