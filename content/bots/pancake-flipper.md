## Pancake Flipper: Tossing the Competition

Pancake Flipper was inspired by the classic breakfast routine - flipping pancakes. We took that concept and applied it to combat robotics with spectacular results.

This 3lb bot features a powerful pneumatic flipper capable of launching opponents completely out of the arena. The flipper covers nearly the entire front section of the bot, providing a large target area to get under opponents.

### Pneumatic System

The heart of Pancake Flipper is its custom-designed pneumatic system. We use a small CO2 cartridge that provides enough pressure for multiple flips during a match. The system is regulated to ensure consistent performance throughout the competition.

The flipper arm is made from aircraft-grade aluminum for the optimal balance of strength and weight. We've designed the system to reset quickly, allowing for rapid consecutive attacks.

### Strategic Advantages

Pancake Flipper excels against opponents with high ground clearance or top-heavy designs. The driving strategy focuses on positioning and timing - getting under an opponent and activating the flipper at precisely the right moment.

The bot has proven particularly effective against horizontal spinners, as it can attack them from the front where the weapon isn't as effective. Several matches have been won by flipping opponents onto their backs, rendering them unable to self-right.
