## The Making of Mighty Mouse

Mighty Mouse was our first venture into the 1lb weight class. Designed with speed and agility in mind, this bot can outmaneuver opponents while delivering devastating blows with its vertical spinner.

The development process began with extensive CAD modeling to optimize weight distribution. We wanted to create a bot that was both fast and stable, which required careful consideration of component placement.

### Design Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was fitting all the necessary components within the 1lb weight limit. We opted for a minimalist frame design and lightweight materials to save weight for the weapon system.

The vertical spinner weapon was chosen for its effectiveness against a variety of opponents. It provides good ground clearance while being able to inflict significant damage.

### Competition Performance

Mighty Mouse has competed in several regional competitions, with its most notable victory being a first-place finish at the Toronto Robotics Championship. Its speed and maneuverability have proven to be significant advantages in the arena.
