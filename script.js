        <h3>Pancake Flipper: Tossing the Competition</h3>
        <p>Pancake Flipper was inspired by the classic breakfast routine - flipping pancakes. We took that concept and applied it to combat robotics with spectacular results.</p>
        <p>This 3lb bot features a powerful pneumatic flipper capable of launching opponents completely out of the arena. The flipper covers nearly the entire front section of the bot, providing a large target area to get under opponents.</p>
        <h4>Pneumatic System</h4>
        <p>The heart of Pancake Flipper is its custom-designed pneumatic system. We use a small CO2 cartridge that provides enough pressure for multiple flips during a match. The system is regulated to ensure consistent performance throughout the competition.</p>
        <p>The flipper arm is made from aircraft-grade aluminum for the optimal balance of strength and weight. We've designed the system to reset quickly, allowing for rapid consecutive attacks.</p>
        <h4>Strategic Advantages</h4>
        <p>Pancake Flipper excels against opponents with high ground clearance or top-heavy designs. The driving strategy focuses on positioning and timing - getting under an opponent and activating the flipper at precisely the right moment.</p>
        <p>The bot has proven particularly effective against horizontal spinners, as it can attack them from the front where the weapon isn't as effective. Several matches have been won by flipping opponents onto their backs, rendering them unable to self-right.</p>

        <h3>Chop Chop: Precision Strikes</h3>
        <p>Chop Chop brings the ancient art of axe combat to the modern robot arena. This 3lb bot features a powerful overhead axe designed to penetrate opponent armor and damage internal components.</p>
        <p>The name "Chop Chop" reflects both the weapon style and our design philosophy of quick, repeated strikes. Unlike some axe bots that rely on single, powerful hits, Chop Chop can deliver multiple rapid strikes in succession.</p>
        <h4>Weapon Design</h4>
        <p>The axe head is made from hardened tool steel with a sharpened edge for maximum penetration. We've carefully balanced the weapon to allow for quick retractions after strikes, minimizing the vulnerability window.</p>
        <p>The axe is powered by a combination of a high-torque servo and a spring-loaded mechanism that stores energy for powerful strikes. This hybrid approach allows for both power and control.</p>
        <h4>Defensive Capabilities</h4>
        <p>Chop Chop isn't just about offense. The bot features a heavily armored front section that doubles as a wedge, allowing it to deflect horizontal spinners and get underneath opponents. The sides are protected by hardened polycarbonate panels that can withstand significant impacts.</p>
        <p>The axe itself serves as a self-righting mechanism. If Chop Chop is flipped over, the axe can be used to push against the arena floor and right the bot - a feature that has saved us in several close matches.</p>

        <h3>Terminated: The Unstoppable Crusher</h3>
        <p>Terminated draws inspiration from sci-fi movies, with a menacing appearance and relentless fighting style. This 3lb bot features a powerful crushing weapon designed to pierce armor and immobilize opponents.</p>
        <p>The red LED "eyes" and metallic skull-like appearance make Terminated instantly recognizable in the arena. The psychological impact on opponents shouldn't be underestimated - several competitors have made driving errors when faced with Terminated's intimidating approach.</p>
        <h4>Crushing Mechanism</h4>
        <p>The heart of Terminated is its hydraulic crushing arm. Using a custom-designed miniature hydraulic system, the crusher can exert over 500 pounds of pressure at the tip - more than enough to penetrate most armor used in the 3lb class.</p>
        <p>The crusher arm is shaped to trap opponents once grabbed, making escape difficult. This allows Terminated to control the match by grabbing an opponent and dragging them around the arena or into hazards.</p>
        <h4>Control System</h4>
        <p>Terminated features one of our most advanced control systems, with pressure sensors in the crusher arm that provide feedback to the operator. This allows for precise control of crushing force - enough to damage components without wasting energy.</p>
        <p>The drive system uses four independently controlled wheels with high-traction rubber tires, giving Terminated excellent pushing power once it has an opponent in its grasp.</p>

        <p>Richard represents the pinnacle of our combat robotics engineering. Named after our founding team captain, this 30lb bot combines raw power with sophisticated control systems to dominate the heavyweight division.</p>
        <p>The development of Richard took over six months, with countless hours spent on design, simulation, testing, and refinement. The result is a bot that has won three consecutive regional championships.</p>
        <h4>Weapon System</h4>
        <p>Richard's primary weapon is a massive horizontal spinner that spans nearly the entire width of the bot. The bar is machined from a single piece of S7 tool steel and weighs approximately 8 pounds - over 25% of the bot's total weight allowance.</p>
        <p>The weapon is powered by a custom-wound brushless motor that delivers over 2 horsepower at maximum speed. The spinner can reach 9,000 RPM, storing an incredible amount of kinetic energy that can tear through opponent armor with ease.</p>
        <h4>Advanced Electronics</h4>
        <p>What truly sets Richard apart is its advanced control system. The bot features a custom-designed control board with gyroscopic stabilization that helps maintain control during intense weapon impacts. The system can detect when the bot is unstable and automatically adjust the drive power to compensate.</p>
        <p>Richard also includes telemetry systems that provide real-time data to the operator, including weapon speed, motor temperatures, battery voltage, and impact detection. This information allows for strategic adjustments during matches.</p>
        <h4>Tournament Success</h4>
        <p>Richard's competition record speaks for itself: 15 wins, 2 losses over three major tournaments. The bot has become something of a legend in the regional circuit, with opponents often modifying their designs specifically to counter Richard's powerful weapon system.</p>
        <p>We continue to refine and improve Richard with each competition, implementing lessons learned and exploring new technologies. The current iteration (Mark IV) features improved armor mounting, better heat management, and an upgraded weapon controller.</p>
